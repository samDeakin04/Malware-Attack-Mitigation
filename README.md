# Malware-Attack-Mitigation

# Project Overview
The project involved responding to a critical malware attack detected in the Security Operation Centre (SOC). Swift action was taken to triage the incident, analyze malware samples, and identify propagation patterns within the network. Through collaborative efforts and proficient use of cybersecurity tools and technologies, the team successfully contained the malware, minimizing its impact on organizational assets. Post-incident, a thorough analysis was conducted to identify root causes and implement measures to enhance future incident response capabilities and strengthen cybersecurity defenses.

## Role and Responsibilities

- Alert triage and initial response coordination.
- Analyzing malware attack data to identify patterns.
- Collaborating with teams to formulate mitigation strategies.
- Developing Python-based firewall rules for malware containment.
- Leading incident postmortem and root cause analysis.

## Skills Demonstrated

- Cybersecurity incident triage and response.
- Data analysis for identifying attack patterns.
- Technical mitigation using Python scripting.
- Incident reflection and postmortem analysis.
- Effective communication and teamwork within a Security Operations environment.

## Achievements

- Successful containment of malware, preventing further spread.
- Implementation of effective firewall rules based on thorough analysis.
- Improvement in incident response processes through postmortem insights.

## Technologies Used
- Security tools for malware detection and analysis.
- Data analysis and visualization tools.
- Python for scripting firewall rules.
- Communication and collaboration platforms used for team coordination.

## Project Impact

The incident postmortem revealed that the malware attack on Telstra's NBN network, exploiting the Spring4Shell zero-day vulnerability, posed a severe threat to data security and network integrity. Through meticulous analysis of firewall logs, abnormal traffic patterns were detected, leading to the swift identification and mitigation of the compromise. Implementation of dedicated firewall rules effectively blocked malicious traffic, restoring network integrity. To prevent future exploits, comprehensive network reviews, enhanced monitoring systems, and collaboration with security experts are prioritized, along with security awareness training and documented incident response procedures.
